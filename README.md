This is the movies management app i created in MERN. Due to my fulltime role as a MERN stack developer in another company which will end on 2nd December 2024 i could not give much time to this app, i hope the reader will understand this. The genre, years, and price filters were not supported by the itunes api so i had to load 200 movies and then filter them. I did not do much work on the ui too due to the time problem but in the last one and a half year i have created many projects and i can talk about that too if you guys want. i did not used redux here but i have used it and redux thunks in todo project which you can find in the same profile. let me know if you need anything else.
